# InvestiQL 

**InvestiQL** is an innovative educational platform that gamifies SQL learning through interactive crime-solving scenarios. Developed as part of a comprehensive database systems course project, this application transforms traditional SQL education into an engaging detective experience.

> **üí° Deployment Status**: While the application is fully developed and functional, live deployment has been postponed due to anticipated operational costs. Initial cost analysis revealed that hosting with expected user volumes would require approximately $150-200/month for database operations, CDN, and compute resources. As a student project developed for academic purposes, securing sustainable funding for ongoing operational expenses remains a challenge. The application is optimized for local development and can be deployed to personal cloud infrastructure.

## üìñ Project Overview

### Academic Context

InvestiQL was developed as a capstone project for **Database Systems and SQL Programming** coursework, demonstrating practical application of:

- Complex database design and normalization
- Advanced SQL query optimization
- Full-stack web application architecture
- User experience design for educational software
- Cloud database integration and deployment

### Core Concept

The platform addresses the common challenge of making SQL education engaging by creating immersive crime-solving scenarios where users must write SQL queries to analyze evidence, track suspects, and solve mysteries.
