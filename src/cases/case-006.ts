      "Outstanding detective work! The evidence conclusively shows that Mike Manning is the thief.",
    explanation: `You began by retrieving the crime scene record and examining witness statements, which mentioned a dock rental, part of a VIP-R invitation and a navy suit.
Filtering marina rentals by these clues returned multiple entries.
A multiple JOIN with the guest table and attire registry returned one candidate.
A final interview with that candidate resulted in a confession.
Thus, the true thief is Mike Manning.`,
